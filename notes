Style of code:
    1. Inconsistent naming "readJson", "JSON" in director.h
    2. Consistent indentation

Documentation:
    1. Code was very well documented. Made it easier to grasp the design implementation

Design of code:
    1. Redundancy: No need for Factory. Builder essentially does the same thing. Builder just additionally returns empty Pool game
    2. Builder pattern aided in building a different representation of the complex Pool game

Coding well done? What would you have done differently?
    1. No. Should have used Qt Library components
    2. Gotten rid of Coordinate class and used QPoint
    3. Delegated the reading of Json to Builder which is essentially doing nothing
        would make it easier for Director to handle more complex functionality like composite balls and decorator
